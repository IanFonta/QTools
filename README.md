## FAQ

#### QTools will have pay tools in the future?

No, QTools will stay completly free for its entire existence.

#### How did you come to create QTools? 

It occurred to me when I noticed the enormous number of pages that seek payment for simply using a tool, and the exclusivity of some. It tires me, I was also one of those who looked for a safe page to convert MP4 to MP3, and due to the lack of these, I ended up on a page with viruses. That's what QTools is for
